# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=('k', 0, 'j', 98, 4, 'n', 'p', 7)
if "n" in x:
    print('n is present in the tuple')
else:
    print('n is not present in the tuple')

if 8 in x:
    print('8 present in the tuple')
else:
    print('8 not present in the tuple')
```

## Result
Thus the Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple executed successfuly.
